To be done:
1. in 'file a new report' and csv file, separate the last seen(time), add a label and entry for last seen date and then last seen time. need to make relevant changes in csv file. you can make the changes to the places where we display info too, i.e add the new details in the order given or you can tell me and i'll do that later
2. tk.Button(frame, text='EDIT', bg='#0EF4DF', font=('verdana', 10, 'normal'), command=new_report).pack(side=LEFT)
need to check if this is logical or not, i.e does it add 2 datas mistakenly sometimes or not
3. you'll need to add an edit button in the window after the displaying info after person being found in database, somewhat similar to what we have with regards to the 'confirm' thing on filing a new report.
4. set up database for mail ids
5. I'll do the filtering function, i.e checking if person's details are already available or not. if they are then i'll link that to the edit function you make so make it with that in mind
6. I'll do the validate date thing
7. i'll create a database for all the data we have and update the program accordingly. will also do final cleanup etc

Labels for date in the folder and making leads for them which you can validate. Then combine them and put it under the existing subdivision in the CSV file for our ease. Displaying can be in the existing format just inputting can be fixed
